This is a living blog.  It will “evolve over time” 😉 to help produce
a clearer picture of what the scripture says about salvation and what that
means for us.

## Edits

Suggested edits are acceptable via PR.  The edits need to be scripture
based or they will be closed abruptly.  Any areas of disagreement are
welcome so long as they remain both true to seeking the meaning of the
Word and cordial in tone.
